## First post - Data

Seeming this is my first post, I belive a good place to start would to be with the term "data" as it is essential for any area of tech to have a good understanding of what data really is (especially in privacy). In todays day and age it is almost garanteed that you are constantly emitting and taking, its part of everyones daily routine. Data is indeed just 1 and 0s, but its what these 1 ands 0s can be processed into is where the power lays. 

What is very important in order to understand and take back your digital privacy is to fully understand and be in controll of your data. This includes having knowledge of where your data is going? who has access to your data? how is your data being handled/used? and so on. Right now a very small perecentage anyone really understands how companies, goverments and criminals are using users data and if its for the good or for the bad. 

Throughout these blog posts I will look at methods at hopefully taking back controll over your data in 


this is the exact reason data is being labelled as 


the new oil of our econmy.
