Something that has newly emerged but also quickly become integral to the majority of first world countries is automatic enforcement of traffic violations(speeding tickets,running red lights and parking tickets). Whether you like it or not, thanks to new technologies such as ANPR(Auto Number Plate Recognition) or LIDAR, governments are now capable of automatically punishing citizens for a offence. This automatic system become really effective, for example in the UK just in 2010 around 45% of all FPN (Fixed Penalty Notices) were automatically captured by a camera , comparing this to 2020 where 97% of FPNs where a camera detected offense([source](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/police-powers-and-procedures-england-and-wales)). This implementation has come with some positives, for example, multiple studies show that speed cameras have heavily reduced car accidents (R) as well as a general decrease in speeding tickets(R). In contrast to these positives, a notable criticism of these systems is that it has built a very strong mass survallience system that has allowed the first fully implemented system that automatically punishes a person for a crime. Is this the only crime that is automatically punishable? How can crimes be automatically punished? Lets look deeper into these questions.



### <u>How can crimes be automatically punishable?</u>

For crimes to be punished automatically it must first be automatically caught/captured, in the case of fines for speeding and parking it uses a huge network of CCTV cameras to capture/detect any possible violations. In addition, the system will also need a way of identify the person in the possible violation, in our example case this would be the number plate. So, for a crime to be automatically punishable there needs to be a system that can automatically detect, then identify the crime being committed. 

Online crimes would definitely be the first thought for crimes that could automatically be punish. However, for this to be possible the government must be able to uniquely identify users as well as be able to monitor internet activity, pairing the to together would allow for automatic punishment. 

#### - Internet Monitoring

In the case of monitoring the internet, governments have been fully capable of doing this([source](https://www.privacyend.com/mass-surveillance/)), this includes internet and email activity, this was proven by the [Edward Snowden leaks](https://blokt.com/guides/edward-snowden-leaks). This essentially works by governments having access to ISPs (Internet Service Providers) and tech companies(The Big Five) data without any warrants, this is important due to the fact that without warrants the process becomes a lot easier for governments to access the data and deal with it in a organised and automatic manner - see [XKeyscore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XKeyscore) and [Boundless Informant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundless_Informant), big data systems used by the NSA. In the case of the UK, the intelligence agency GCHQ has access to pretty much all major ISPs undersea cables under a codenamed system called [Tempora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempora) ([source](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/02/telecoms-bt-vodafone-cables-gchq)). As we can see monitoring is not at all an issue for governments.

#### - Unique Identification

A very easy way to uniquely identify a person is from the ISP, from the previous section we are aware that governments have no issues in gathering data directly from ISPs, in addition to the data they will also have access to your address, billing details and even your social security number. 

Another method of identifying users is by using device and browser fingerprinting , this is when companies use device identifiers to uniquely identify a user to that device or browser. In the case of mobile there are the following methods of uniquely identifying a device; advertising IDs, Device IDs(Serial numbers,imei number and mac & ip address) and account IDs (email accounts, device accounts). 

When it comes to PCs what is more common is browser fingerprinting. This method is pretty similar to the device fingerprinting used on mobiles but in the case of browsers fingerprinting they use information that can be extracted from your browser such as software and device information as well as things like your currently installed extensions  to create a unique id. Companies can include scripts and trackers into there websites which will allow them to access your browser fingerprint. Once a service such as Google or Amazon have your browser fingerprint that can track you around the web with techniques like super cookies. 

Although this can be relatively easy to avoid for tech literate people the average user will most likely be affected by digital fingerprint, as a result this is a very reliable method of uniquely identifying individuals in addition to pairing their internet activity to this unique ID. This is mainly used as by big tech companies but as we know governments can easily access data from "The Tech Giants".

## Facial Recognition

This is another prime example of a very powerful, newly emerging technology that is and will provide governments with a way to uniquely identify their citizens. This has become more widely covered as the possible downsides to this technology are clear. This would provide a incredibly good way for governments to automatically capture crimes and then link them to a unique ID.  In fact, this is already being implemented in the majority of countries in the world - both this [article](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/facial-recognition-world-map/?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=pmd_W6itMfd0tqPiZCliwu_6NxDbYpeEb5MbdEKiayTT3_4-1634972492-0-gqNtZGzNAxCjcnBszQhl) and this [article](https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/biometric-data-study/) cover the current state of each country in regards to facial recognition. China is one of the biggest adopters of facial recognition technology, with over 200million estimated CTTV cameras(That's almost 1 CCTV camera for every 7 citizens) surveillance through facial recognition is pretty much a standard now.



### <u>Crimes that have automated punishments</u>

A very apt example of where people are being automatically punished is the current situation with COVID-19 tracking. Using facial recognition certain countries, specifically Russia used facial recognition technology to track and identifying people who were breaking Covid-19 restrictions ([S](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-europe-52157131)).

An instance where automation has been implemented is in relation to copy right infringement, many ISP(Internet Service Providers) will send out automatic warnings if a users IP address is associated with pirating([S1](https://torrentfreak.com/google-fiber-sends-automated-piracy-fines-to-subscribers-150520/?) - S2). The reason they are warnings not fines is because the ISP is not the person giving out the fines, the company that holds the rights to original content will request data from the ISP to use in a case. It has been known for ISPs to send out automatic messages to there users if they believe they are related to an instant of pirating/copy right infringement. In this case of piracy we can see that some governments/companies are able to fully or at the very least partially automate the process of detecting the crime however the actual punishment requires going through the court systems.



### Conclusion

To conclude there is no doubt that the current technology has the power to automatically punish offences, however the true scope of this is obviously not available to the public. Currently there is no doubt that technology for detecting possible offensive is being used effectively by multiple governments but in the case of actual punishment there is still a lot of human interaction and decision used. It will be very interesting to see if in the future crimes will be automatically punished. There is also the limitation of punishment as physical arrest is required, I would presume that intelligence for arrests is going to primarily be digital in the near future.
